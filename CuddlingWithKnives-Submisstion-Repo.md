We filled our own repository with everything relating to our submission, we are using an abstract tool (OutSystems) and 
seperating our team into groups on different tasks, designed to make a mockup of something to use and the most relevant information 
based on water security and education.

I'm not sure if that made any sense, but we're trying to maximise our time to make the best mockup and presentation within the time limit. 
OutSystems is awesome, and we have some experts within that tool, and a team that is great with design. Please check out the link and shoot 
me a message (Ph. 0422256599) if you wanted to ask any questions about our project.
